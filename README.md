var name = "value"

var num1 = 5
var num2 = 7

!println("Prints something with a newline")
!print("Prints something without a newline")
!expyth(" print('This lets you execute python code!') ")

if (num1 < num2) {
	!println("This condition is true!")
}
```

Output:
```
Prints something with a newline
Prints something without a newlineThis lets you execute python code!

This condition is true!
```
